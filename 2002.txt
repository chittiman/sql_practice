Submission Types

Write a query that returns the user ID of all users that have created 
at least one ‘Refinance’ submission and at least one ‘InSchool’ submission.

loans

id:int
user_id:int
created_at:datetime
status:varchar
type:varchar

Thinking:
Mistake made  - Did where type in (Refinance, Inschool) but that returns the user ID
of all users that have created at least one ‘Refinance’ submission and at least 
one ‘InSchool’ submission.

So, Used intersection method

My Solution:
select 
    user_id 
from loans 
    where type = 'Refinance'
intersect
select 
    user_id 
from loans 
    where type = 'InSchool'

Failed attempt with Case - Tried creating truth columns for both Inschool and Refinance
and tried to take and statement. But this will always return false

Other solutions

select  user_id
from loans
where type = 'Refinance' or type = 'InSchool'
group by 1
having count(distinct type) = 2

Grouping and counting distinct types


select user_id from loans
group by 1
having 
    count(case when type = 'Refinance' then type end)>=1 and 
    count(case when type = 'InSchool' then type end)>=1
